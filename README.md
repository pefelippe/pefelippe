## Pedro Felippe - Software Developer

I use my technical skills to build to build user-friendly web apps and create RESTful APIs.

Focused on the JavaScript ecosystem, I craft interfaces with React/Next.js. On the backend, I utilize Node and Golang, manage databases, and handle UI/UX, all integrated with CI/CD pipelines.

In my free time, I've been developing personal projects from scratch, overseeing the backend, frontend, UI/UX, marketing, and more.

Feel free to reach out and explore more about my work and projects.
