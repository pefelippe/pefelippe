## iFelippe - Software Developer

Hey There.

I use my technical skills in JavaScript to build user-friendly web apps and create RESTful APIs with Node and sometimes GraphQL. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging cloud providers to enhance web applications.

Currently working as a Software Developer at Instituto Atlântico.

Feel free to reach out and explore more about my work and projects.
